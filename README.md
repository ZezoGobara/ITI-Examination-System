# ITI-Examination-System
I developed a complete Examination Management System for ITI, designed to efficiently manage students, courses, questions, exams, and answers â€” with the goal of streamlining exam administration and improving performance tracking.

I used the following tools and technologies throughout the project:
SQL Server and SSMS for designing the database and writing stored procedures.
Redgate and Excel to generate realistic test data and validate the system.
SSIS to build ETL pipelines that transfer data from the operational database to the data warehouse model.
SSRS for creating dynamic and interactive reports.
Power BI to build insightful analytics dashboards for performance monitoring and data-driven decision-making.
